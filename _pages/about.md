My name is María Florencia Gayraud and I am from Puerto Madryn, a small city in the northern Patagonia. 

I currently work as a Senior Analyst in the Justice Area at [Fundar](https://fund.ar), where I conduct research primarily focused on the modernization of Argentina’s justice system. 

I hold a strong academic background, with a Master’s degree in Public Policy and a Bachelor’s degree in Political Science and Government from Torcuato Di Tella University, where I developed a keen focus on quantitative research. 

My **professional approach** combines analytical rigor with a strong commitment to ***justice, feminism, and data-driven insights***.

I have collaborated on projects with renowned institutions, such as the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, the University of Oxford, and the Center for the Implementation of Public Policies for Equity and Growth (CIPPEC). 

Additionally, I serve as an assistant professor in several courses at Universidad Torcuato Di Tella.
