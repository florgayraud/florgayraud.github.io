My name is María Florencia Gayraud and I am from [Puerto Madryn](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qLUe9vPnX6wTbhtB8), a small city in the northern Patagonia of Argentina. I moved to Buenos Aires in 2016 and now I am living in the UK. 

I am currently a first-year DPhil candidate in Politics at the [University of Oxford](https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/person/maria-florencia-gayraud), where my research sits at the intersection of comparative judicial politics, gender equality, and computational text analysis. My doctoral project examines why Latin American high courts vary in the extent to which they incorporate gender-sensitive reasoning in their rulings, combining qualitative insight with large-scale analysis of judicial decisions.

Before starting my DPhil, I worked four and a half year as a Senior Analyst in the Justice Area at [Fundar](https://fund.ar), where I conduct research primarily focused on the modernization of Argentina’s justice system. Additionally, since 2022 I have taught and assisted in several courses at Universidad Torcuato Di Tella.

I have a strong academic background, with a Master’s degree in Public Policy and a Bachelor’s degree in Political Science and Government from Torcuato Di Tella University, where I developed a keen focus on quantitative research. 

I have collaborated on projects with renowned institutions, such as the Konrad Adenauer Stiftung, Nuffield College (University of Oxford), and the Pulte Institute (University of Notre Dame).
