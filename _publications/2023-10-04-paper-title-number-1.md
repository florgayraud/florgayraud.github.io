Argentina has a vast regulatory framework that guarantees legal equality, but making this
principle a reality requires concrete actions. In this regard, integrating a gender perspective
into the justice administration system is a fundamental step to avoid reproducing inequalities.
Through the development of an own database, this study aims to analyze the votes of judges
in provincial high courts in decisions with a gender perspective, as compiled by the Office of
Women of the National Supreme Court of Justice. In the absence of a Protocol for Judging
with a Gender Perspective at both the national and subnational levels, this study seeks to
evaluate, using the Supreme Court Protocol of Mexico as a measurement criterion, how
judges ultimately argue their decisions when claiming to have a gender perspective in their
judgments. It is intended to demonstrate that what ultimately happens is that these rulings
have favorable results for women, but not an argumentation with a gender perspective.
Through the analysis of 564 votes in 143 judgments, it was found that only half of them use
the gender perspective as an argumentative tool. Furthermore, the profile of the judges was
proposed as an explanatory factor for these results, finding that young female judges are
more likely to incorporate the gender perspective in their argumentation. This evidence
supports the need to develop a protocol with a gender perspective that maximizes Argentine
legislation and addresses the needs and demands of justice operators themselves.
