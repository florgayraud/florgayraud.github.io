Through the analysis of 564 votes in 143 sentences, it was found that only half use gender perspective as an argumentative tool. Furthermore, the profile of judges, finding that younger female judges are more likely to incorporate gender perspective into their arguments, is proposed as an explanatory factor for these results. This evidence supports the need to develop a protocol with a gender perspective that maximizes Argentine legislation and addresses the needs and demands of justice operators.
